### The Modern Code Editor for AI Agents 

# Code 10x Faster With No Switching Cost

Superset orchestrates CLI-based coding agents across isolated git worktrees, with built-in terminal, review, and open-in-editor workflows.

- **Run multiple agents simultaneously** without context switching overhead
- **Isolate each task** in its own git worktree so agents don't interfere with each other
- **Monitor all your agents** from one place and get notified when they need attention
- **Review and edit changes quickly** with the built-in diff viewer and editor
- **Open any workspace where you need it** with one-click handoff to your editor or terminal

Wait less, ship more.

### Build from Source

<details>
<summary>Click to expand build instructions</summary>

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezeslucky/velix.git
cd velix
```

**2. Set up environment variables** (choose one):

Option A: Full setup
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in the values
```

Option B: Skip env validation (for quick local testing)

echo 'SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1' >> .env
```

**3. Set up Caddy** (reverse proxy for Electric SQL streams):

```bash
# Install caddy: brew install caddy (macOS) or see https://caddyserver.com/docs/install
cp Caddyfile.example Caddyfile

# Without this, Chromium rejects https://localhost:* with ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID.
# Prompts for sudo once.
caddy trust
```

**4. Install dependencies and run**

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

**5. Build the desktop app**
